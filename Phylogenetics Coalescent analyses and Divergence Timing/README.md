## Phylogenetic trees (Chow)  
### Required files 
FASTA alignment with name up to 256 charcters long. To align WGS with SNP data, use https://github.com/broadinstitute/broad-fungalgroup

Follow these from Tremble et al. Coalescent phylogenomic reconstruction of the group from 702 single-copy gene trees. 

Construct ML phylogenies using ```RAxML v8.0``` using GTRCAT nucleotide substitution model and boostrap based on 1,000 replicates. 

## Maximum clade credibility phylogenetic tree using BEAST (Chow)  
First we need to estimate a mutation rate for each clade using TempEst
``  
``
## Neighbor joining trees with ADEGENET
Then using BEAST under strict molecular clock and GTR substitution model run for 500 million MCMC steps we can make tree
## Evoloutionary rate and molecular dating of clades (Chow)

## Cross-coalescence analysis to time differntiation between clades (Schweizer)

## Time to last common ancestor calculated in BEAST (Chow)

## Coalescent simulations (Stonesenbo)
