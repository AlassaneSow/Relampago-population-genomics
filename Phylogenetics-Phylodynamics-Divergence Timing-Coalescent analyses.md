##Phylogenetic trees (Chow)  
Required files 
FASTA alignment with name up to 256 charcters long. To align WGS with SNP data, use
Construct ML phylogenies using ```RAxML v8.0``` using GTRCAT nucleotide substitution model and boostrap based on 1,000 replicates. 

#Maximum clade credibility phylogenetic tree using BEAST (Chow)  
First we need to estimate a mutation rate for each clade using TempEst
``  
``  
Then using BEAST under strict molecular clock and GTR substitution model run for 500 million MCMC steps we can make tree
##Evoloutionary rate and molecular dating of clades (Chow)

##Cross-coalescence analysis to time differntiation between clades (Schweizer)

##Time to last common ancestor calculated in BEAST (Chow)

##Coalescent simulations (Stonesenbo)
