# Relampago population genomics
Code used for genome assembly of Parvodontia relampaga and analysis of its population structure, ecology, and evolution. Each folder represents one major step of the analysis. In each folder you will find:
  1) A markdown that summarises the commands and programs used, my thought process behind using them, and occasional trouble shooting information
  2) The full scripts used for each analysis/process
