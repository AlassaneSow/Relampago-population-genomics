# Relampago population genomics
Code used for genome assembly and population structure, ecological, and evolutionary analyses. Each folder represents one major step of the analysis. In each folder you will find:
  1) A markdown that summarises the commands and programs used, the thought process behind using them, and occasional trouble shooting information
  2) The full scripts used for each analysis/process.
