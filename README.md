# Relampago population genomics
Code used for genome assembly of Parvodontia relampaga and analysis of its population structure, ecology, and evolution. Each folder represents one major step of the analysis. In each folder you will find:
  1) A markdown that summarises the commands and programs used, my thought process behind using them, and occasional trouble shooting information
  2) The full scripts used for each analysis/process


note to self. 
one paper describing population strucutre, migration patterns, naivte or not? host-pathogen genotyper interactions  
one paper desribing migration patterns, genes involved in local adaptation, and ecological niche modeling
